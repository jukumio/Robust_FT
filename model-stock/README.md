### Abstract
> This paper introduces an efficient fine-tuning method for large pre-trained models, offering strong in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) performance. Breaking away from traditional practices that need a multitude of fine-tuned models for averaging, our approach employs significantly fewer models to achieve final weights yet yield superior accuracy. Drawing from key insights in the weight space of fine-tuned weights, we uncover a strong link between the performance and proximity to the center of weight space. Based on this, we introduce a method that approximates a center-close weight using only two fine-tuned models, applicable during or after training. Our innovative layer-wise weight averaging technique surpasses state-of-the-art model methods such as Model Soup, utilizing only two fine-tuned models. This strategy can be aptly coined *Model Stock*, highlighting its reliance on selecting a minimal number of models to draw a more optimized-averaged model. We demonstrate the efficacy of Model Stock with fine-tuned models based upon pre-trained CLIP architectures, achieving remarkable performance on both ID and OOD tasks on the standard benchmarks, all while barely bringing extra computational demands.

## Method preview
We utilize the geometric properties of the weights of fine-tuned models. We find optimal merging ratio for each layer by minimizing the distance between the merged weight and the center of the weights of fine-tuned models. The following figure shows the overview of Model Stock.

We present two scenarios: a small angle (left) and a large angle (right) between two fine-tuned weights (w_1, w_2) and a pre-trained weight (w_0). The gray triangle spans these weights, representing our search space. The optimal point on this triangle closest to the ideal center (Î¼) is the perpendicular foot (w_H), determined by the angle between the fine-tuned models. When the angle (Î¸) is large (right), w_H relies more on w_0. For details, please refer to our paper.

## Run Model Stock 
### Setup 
- Install [Model Soups](https://github.com/mlfoundations/model-soups) repository. We will use its `datasets/` and `utils.py`.
### Notebooks
- This [tutorial notebook](notebooks/model_stock_example.ipynb) will help understanding how Model Stock works. Note that it is the simplified run of Model Stock without periodic merging. 
- This [evaluation notebook](notebooks/model_stock_eval.ipynb) will show the performance of pre-uploaded Model Stock weights on ImageNet and five distribution shift benchmarks.
- End-to-end training and evaluation code will be released soon.

### Third-party implementation
- Implementation by [merge-kit](https://github.com/arcee-ai/mergekit/blob/main/mergekit/merge_methods/model_stock.py)
